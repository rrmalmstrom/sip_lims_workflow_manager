# LIMS Workflow Manager - Development Progress

**Last Updated:** 2025-09-10

This document tracks the development progress of the LIMS Workflow Manager application.

## Current Status

We have successfully completed a major refactoring of the application's core logic, fixed critical bugs related to script execution, and implemented a robust success marker system for reliable rollback functionality.

### Key Accomplishments:
1.  **Initial Analysis**: Reviewed `README.md` and `plan.md` to understand the project's architecture and goals.
2.  **Test Suite Overhaul**: Created a new, robust test suite (`tests/test_core_logic.py`) using a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. This provides a solid baseline for future development.
3.  **Core Logic Refactoring**: The monolithic `Project` class in `src/core.py` was refactored into smaller, more focused components, which now reside in `src/logic.py`:
    *   `StateManager`: For handling `workflow_state.json`.
    *   `SnapshotManager`: For managing snapshots.
    *   `ScriptRunner`: For executing workflow scripts.
4.  **Bug Fix: Script Execution**: Identified and fixed a critical bug where the application was unreliably locating the `scripts` folder. The logic was updated to be independent of the current working directory, ensuring scripts run correctly regardless of how the application is launched.
5.  **Documentation Updates**:
    *   `README.md`: Updated with a new section explaining to script authors that the script's working directory is always the project folder.
    *   `plan.md`: The technical design document was updated to reflect the new refactored architecture and the script execution context.

## Next Steps (To-Do List)

### Session 2: Interactive Debugging & Feature Enhancement
1.  **Project Loading Logic**: Implemented robust error handling for project loading.
    *   The application now detects when a `workflow.yml` file is missing.
    *   If a project database (`.db`) exists, it offers to restore the `workflow.yml` from the latest snapshot.
    *   If no database exists, it offers to create a new `workflow.yml` from a centralized, correct template file, preventing the use of outdated or incorrect workflow definitions.
2.  **Core Logic Testing**: Added a comprehensive set of `pytest` tests for the new project loading and snapshot restoration logic, ensuring the backend is stable and correct.
3.  **Interactive Script Execution Debugging**: Undertook a major debugging and refactoring effort to resolve a persistent deadlock issue where interactive scripts would hang.
    *   Refactored the `ScriptRunner` and `Project` core classes multiple times to address complex threading and process management issues.
    *   The final, stable implementation uses a non-blocking background thread to run the script and a polling mechanism in the main UI thread to safely check for completion, resolving all deadlocks and race conditions.
4.  **GUI Enhancements**: Implemented several user-requested UI improvements.
    *   The "Run" button for a step is now disabled until all required file inputs for that step have been provided by the user.
    *   The input box in the pseudo-terminal now automatically clears after input is sent.

### Session 3: Success Marker Implementation & Rollback Fix
1. **Critical Rollback Bug Fix**: Identified and resolved a major issue where scripts that failed during execution were incorrectly being marked as "completed" instead of triggering rollback functionality.
    * **Root Cause**: Python scripts were exiting with code 0 (success) even when they encountered errors, preventing the rollback logic from triggering.
    * **Solution**: Implemented a success marker file system where scripts create `.workflow_status/{script_name}.success` files only upon successful completion.
2. **Success Marker Implementation**: Updated all 19 workflow scripts with success marker functionality:
    * Added success marker creation code to every workflow script
    * Enhanced GUI logic in `src/core.py` with `handle_step_result()` and `_check_success_marker()` methods
    * Implemented dual verification: both exit codes AND success marker files are checked
3. **Interactive Script Restoration**: Reverted from subprocess.Popen back to pseudo-terminal (PTY) approach to restore proper interactive script functionality while maintaining enhanced failure detection.
4. **Workflow Configuration Fixes**: Corrected script name mismatches in all workflow.yml files:
    * Fixed `make_clarity_summary.py` ‚Üí `make.clarity.summary.py`
    * Fixed `fill_clarity_lib_creation_sheet.py` ‚Üí `fill.clarity.lib.creation.sheet.py`
5. **User Verification**: Confirmed that interactive prompts display properly, rollback detection works correctly, and "ROLLBACK:" messages appear when scripts fail.

### Session 4: Enhanced GUI Features & Complete Snapshot System
1. **Enhanced Re-run File Input Behavior**: Implemented smart re-run functionality that always prompts for new file inputs.
    * Modified GUI logic to show file input widgets for completed steps during re-run preparation
    * Added automatic input clearing with user notification for re-runs
    * Enhanced re-run button logic to require new file inputs before enabling
    * Users now see clear messaging about re-run setup and input requirements
2. **Complete Undo Functionality**: Implemented comprehensive undo system with complete project state restoration.
    * **Enhanced Snapshot System**: Added `take_complete_snapshot()` and `restore_complete_snapshot()` methods
    * **Complete Project Restoration**: Undo now restores entire project directory to previous state
    * **Smart File Management**: Excludes system files and preserves essential directories during restoration
    * **GUI Integration**: Added undo button with two-click confirmation system in sidebar
3. **Critical Bug Fixes**: Resolved success marker naming issues across all workflow scripts.
    * Fixed success marker file naming convention in all 19 workflow scripts
    * Updated scripts to use `Path(__file__).stem` for consistent naming
    * Enhanced core logic to support both legacy and complete snapshot systems
4. **Test-Driven Development**: Created comprehensive test suite for new GUI features.
    * Added `tests/test_gui_features.py` with 9 test cases covering both new features
    * All tests passing (20 total: 9 new + 11 existing core logic tests)
    * Enhanced existing tests for success marker compatibility

### Session 5: Pseudo-Terminal Bug Fix & Enhanced Terminal Visibility
1. **Critical Pseudo-Terminal Bug Resolution**: Systematically debugged and fixed the ultracentrifuge script pseudo-terminal issue.
    * **Root Cause Analysis**: Identified multiple contributing factors preventing terminal display
    * **YAML Syntax Fix**: Removed duplicate `inputs:` sections in workflow.yml causing parsing errors
    * **Path Construction Bug**: Fixed script logic creating duplicate directory paths causing FileNotFoundError
    * **Script Structure Cleanup**: Standardized script structure to match working setup isotope script
2. **Enhanced Terminal Visibility**: Implemented prominent visual indicators for better user experience.
    * **Visual Enhancement Strategy**: Replaced complex JavaScript auto-scroll with native Streamlit indicators
    * **Prominent Terminal Display**: Added large "üñ•Ô∏è LIVE TERMINAL" header with colored alert banners
    * **User Guidance**: Clear messaging about interactive input requirements and terminal location
    * **Consistent Behavior**: Ultracentrifuge script now works identically to setup isotope script
3. **Technical Implementation**: Fixed core issues in multiple components.
    * **workflow.yml**: Corrected invalid YAML syntax in dummy_chakraborty_ultra project
    * **ultracentrifuge.transfer.py**: Fixed path construction logic for GUI-provided file paths
    * **app.py**: Enhanced terminal display with prominent visual indicators and user guidance

### Session 6: Granular Undo System for Individual Step Re-runs
1. **Comprehensive Granular Undo Implementation**: Developed complete system for undoing individual step re-runs.
    * **Enhanced Snapshot System**: Implemented dual snapshot strategy (before/after each run) for precise state tracking
    * **Run Number Management**: Added methods to track and manage unlimited re-runs per step
    * **Progressive Undo Logic**: Each undo operation targets exactly one run, not entire steps
    * **Intelligent Step Status**: Step remains "completed" as long as successful runs exist
2. **Universal Compatibility**: Ensured granular undo works for all steps in any workflow configuration.
    * **Generic Implementation**: All methods work with dynamic step identification, not hardcoded step names
    * **Backward Compatibility**: Existing single-run workflows continue to work without modification
    * **Graceful Fallback**: Legacy snapshot naming supported for existing projects
3. **Enhanced SnapshotManager Methods**: Added comprehensive run tracking and management capabilities.
    * **`get_next_run_number()`**: Determines run number for new executions by analyzing existing snapshots
    * **`get_effective_run_number()`**: Tracks current effective run after undos by checking remaining snapshots
    * **`remove_run_snapshots_from()`**: Removes snapshots to track undo progress and prevent repeated undos
4. **Robust Testing and Validation**: Thoroughly tested complete granular undo sequence with multiple scenarios.
    * **Multi-run Testing**: Verified unlimited re-runs with proper snapshot creation and tracking
    * **Progressive Undo Testing**: Confirmed each undo goes back exactly one run with correct file restoration
    * **Step Status Validation**: Verified intelligent step status management across all undo scenarios
    * **Final Undo Testing**: Confirmed proper transition to "pending" status when all runs are undone

### Session 7: Enhanced Undo with Previous Step Restoration
1. **Critical Undo Bug Investigation**: Identified issue where undo button appeared but did nothing when clicked for the last remaining run of a step.
    * **Root Cause Analysis**: Original logic assumed consecutive "after" snapshots existed, but previous undo operations created gaps
    * **Evidence Analysis**: Missing "after" snapshots were from successful previous undos, not failed runs
    * **Logic Gap Identified**: System couldn't handle restoration when no current step "after" snapshots existed
2. **Enhanced Backwards Search Implementation**: Developed robust algorithm to handle gaps in "after" snapshots.
    * **Backwards Search Algorithm**: Searches through all possible previous "after" snapshots, not just immediate previous
    * **Previous Step Restoration**: When no current step "after" snapshots exist, restores to previous step's latest "after" snapshot
    * **Proper State Management**: Correctly marks steps as "pending" and removes success markers when undoing entire steps
3. **Comprehensive TDD Testing**: Created complete test suite for the enhanced undo functionality.
    * **Test Suite Creation**: `tests/test_granular_undo_fix.py` with 9 comprehensive test cases
    * **Scenario Coverage**: Gap handling, normal operation, edge cases, and previous step restoration
    * **Test Results**: All 9 tests passed, validating the fix across all scenarios
4. **Manual Testing Verification**: Confirmed fix works in real-world scenario with `dummy_chakraborty` project.
    * **Issue Reproduction**: Verified undo button appeared but did nothing for ultracentrifuge step
    * **Fix Validation**: Confirmed undo now properly restores to previous step (setup_plates) state
    * **Complete Functionality**: Verified granular undo works for all scenarios including previous step restoration
5. **Documentation Updates**: Updated technical documentation to reflect the enhanced undo functionality.
    * **TECHNICAL_NOTES.md**: Added comprehensive Session 7 section with implementation details
    * **SUMMARY.md**: Updated project summary with latest features and accomplishments
    * **PROGRESS.md**: Documented complete development progression including latest fix
