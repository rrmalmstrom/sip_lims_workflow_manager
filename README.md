## Prerequisites

-   **Docker Desktop**: The application runs in a container to ensure consistency.
-   **Git**: Used to automatically download and update the scientific workflow scripts.

## Installation and First-Time Setup

The setup process needs to be performed only **once** per computer.

1.  **Download the Application**: Download the `sip_lims_workflow_manager` folder (as a `.zip` file) from the latest GitHub release and unzip it to a permanent location on your computer (e.g., your Desktop or Documents folder).
2.  **Run the Setup Script**: This script builds the application's Docker image on your computer.
    -   **On macOS**: Open the `sip_lims_workflow_manager` folder and double-click the `setup_docker.command` file.
    -   **On Windows**: Open the `sip_lims_workflow_manager` folder and double-click the `setup_docker.bat` file.

## Running the Application

After the one-time setup is complete, you can start the application at any time:

-   **On macOS**: Double-click the `run.command` file.
-   **On Windows**: Double-click the `run.bat` file.

The first time you run the application, it will automatically download the necessary scientific workflow scripts. On subsequent runs, it will check for and apply any available script updates. A terminal window will open, and the application's user interface will open in your default web browser.
