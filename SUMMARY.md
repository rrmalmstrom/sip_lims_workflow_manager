# Project Summary: LIMS Workflow Manager (v3)

## 1. Project Goal
To create a simple, lightweight, cross-platform GUI application to manage and execute a series of Python-based laboratory workflow scripts, with robust error handling and version control for the scripts.

## 2. Current Status
- **Phase 1 (Core Engine):** Complete. All logic for parsing, state management, snapshots, and script execution is implemented and tested. Success marker system implemented for reliable rollback functionality.
- **Phase 2 (GUI):** Complete. The Streamlit UI is fully featured with interactive script execution, enhanced failure detection, smart re-run behavior, and comprehensive undo functionality.
- **Phase 3 (Distribution):** Complete. The script-based distribution model using Git is implemented and tested on macOS. Awaiting final Windows test.
- **Phase 4 (Workflow Implementation):** Complete. The production `workflow.yml` and user `README.md` are authored. All 19 workflow scripts updated with success markers.
- **Phase 5 (Rollback & Reliability):** Complete. Critical rollback functionality fixed with success marker implementation.
- **Phase 6 (Enhanced GUI Features):** Complete. Smart re-run file input behavior and comprehensive undo functionality with complete project state restoration.
- **Phase 7 (Pseudo-Terminal Bug Fixes):** Complete. Resolved critical pseudo-terminal display issues and enhanced terminal visibility for all interactive scripts.
- **Phase 8 (Granular Undo System):** Complete. Implemented comprehensive granular undo for individual step re-runs with unlimited re-run support and intelligent step status management.

## 3. Key Design Decisions
- **Core Engine:** A generic engine that reads workflow definitions from a `workflow.yml` file.
- **State Management:** Workflow progress is tracked in a `workflow_state.json` file, supporting "pending", "completed", and "skipped" states.
- **Undo/Redo:** Implemented via a snapshot mechanism.
- **Error Handling:** The engine automatically restores the pre-run snapshot if any script fails. Enhanced with success marker files for reliable failure detection.
- **Script Management (Centralized Git Repository):**
    - The application's workflow scripts are managed in a central, private Git repository and cloned into a local `scripts` folder during setup.
- **Distribution Model:** The application is distributed as a folder. A one-time `setup` script prepares the environment. A `run` script launches the app.

## 4. Recent Major Accomplishments
1. **Critical Rollback Bug Fix**: Resolved issue where failed scripts were incorrectly marked as "completed" instead of triggering rollback.
2. **Success Marker System**: Implemented reliable failure detection using `.workflow_status/{script_name}.success` files.
3. **Script Updates**: All 19 workflow scripts updated with success marker functionality.
4. **Configuration Fixes**: Corrected script name mismatches in workflow.yml files.
5. **Interactive Functionality**: Restored proper interactive script execution while maintaining enhanced failure detection.
6. **Enhanced Re-run Behavior**: Implemented smart re-run functionality that always prompts for new file inputs, preventing accidental reuse of old data.
7. **Complete Undo System**: Implemented comprehensive undo functionality with complete project state restoration using enhanced snapshot system.
8. **Success Marker Bug Fixes**: Fixed naming convention issues across all 19 workflow scripts for reliable completion detection.
9. **Pseudo-Terminal Bug Resolution**: Systematically debugged and fixed critical pseudo-terminal display issues for ultracentrifuge script.
10. **Enhanced Terminal Visibility**: Implemented prominent visual indicators to make interactive terminals impossible to miss.
11. **Granular Undo System**: Implemented comprehensive granular undo for individual step re-runs with unlimited re-run support.
12. **Intelligent Step Status Management**: Enhanced step status to accurately reflect completion state across multiple re-runs.
13. **Progressive Undo Logic**: Each undo operation targets exactly one run, not entire steps, with proper snapshot tracking.

## 5. Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
1. **Enhanced Logging**: Improve GUI feedback and real-time information display.
2. **Script Update Mechanism**: Enhance reliability and user experience of script updates.
3. **Workflow Validation**: Implement validation for `workflow.yml` file syntax and structure.
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Perform full end-to-end testing on both macOS and Windows platforms.

## 6. Latest Features (Session 4)
### Enhanced Re-run File Input Behavior
- **Problem Solved**: Re-runs now always prompt for new file inputs instead of reusing previous selections
- **User Experience**: Clear messaging and automatic input clearing for fresh data selection
- **Implementation**: Modified GUI logic in `app.py` with smart input widget management

### Complete Undo Functionality
- **Problem Solved**: Comprehensive project state restoration that removes all files/directories created by undone steps
- **Technical Implementation**: Enhanced snapshot system with `take_complete_snapshot()` and `restore_complete_snapshot()` methods
- **User Experience**: Two-click confirmation system with detailed restoration feedback
- **Reliability**: Smart file exclusions and complete directory structure restoration

## 7. Latest Features (Session 5)
### Pseudo-Terminal Bug Resolution
- **Problem Solved**: Ultracentrifuge script pseudo-terminal was not appearing, preventing interactive user input
- **Root Causes Fixed**: Invalid YAML syntax, path construction bugs, and script structure inconsistencies
- **Technical Implementation**: Fixed workflow.yml parsing, corrected file path logic, and standardized script structure
- **Result**: Ultracentrifuge script now works identically to setup isotope script

### Enhanced Terminal Visibility
- **Problem Solved**: Users couldn't easily locate the terminal when it appeared at the top of the page
- **Solution**: Replaced complex JavaScript auto-scroll with prominent native Streamlit visual indicators
- **User Experience**: Large "üñ•Ô∏è LIVE TERMINAL" header, colored alert banners, and clear messaging
- **Reliability**: Works consistently across all browsers and doesn't depend on JavaScript execution

## 8. Latest Features (Session 6)
### Granular Undo for Individual Step Re-runs
- **Problem Solved**: Users needed to undo individual re-runs of steps, not entire steps when multiple runs existed
- **Root Causes Fixed**: Original undo system designed for linear workflows, couldn't handle multiple runs per step
- **Technical Implementation**: Enhanced snapshot system with run-specific tracking and progressive undo logic
- **Key Features**:
  - **Unlimited Re-runs**: Any step can be re-run unlimited times with proper tracking
  - **Granular Undo**: Each undo goes back exactly one run, not entire steps
  - **Intelligent Status**: Step remains "completed" as long as successful runs exist
  - **Progressive Restoration**: Files from only the most recent run are removed per undo
- **Snapshot Strategy**: Dual snapshot system (before/after each run) for precise state restoration
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works for all steps in any workflow configuration with backward compatibility
