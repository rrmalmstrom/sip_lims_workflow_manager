# Project Summary: LIMS Workflow Manager (v3)

## 1. Project Goal
To create a simple, lightweight, cross-platform GUI application to manage and execute a series of Python-based laboratory workflow scripts, with robust error handling and version control for the scripts.

## 2. Current Status
- **Phase 1 (Core Engine):** Complete. All logic for parsing, state management, snapshots, and script execution is implemented and tested. Success marker system implemented for reliable rollback functionality.
- **Phase 2 (GUI):** Complete. The Streamlit UI is fully featured with interactive script execution and enhanced failure detection.
- **Phase 3 (Distribution):** Complete. The script-based distribution model using Git is implemented and tested on macOS. Awaiting final Windows test.
- **Phase 4 (Workflow Implementation):** Complete. The production `workflow.yml` and user `README.md` are authored. All 19 workflow scripts updated with success markers.
- **Phase 5 (Rollback & Reliability):** Complete. Critical rollback functionality fixed with success marker implementation.

## 3. Key Design Decisions
- **Core Engine:** A generic engine that reads workflow definitions from a `workflow.yml` file.
- **State Management:** Workflow progress is tracked in a `workflow_state.json` file, supporting "pending", "completed", and "skipped" states.
- **Undo/Redo:** Implemented via a snapshot mechanism.
- **Error Handling:** The engine automatically restores the pre-run snapshot if any script fails. Enhanced with success marker files for reliable failure detection.
- **Script Management (Centralized Git Repository):**
    - The application's workflow scripts are managed in a central, private Git repository and cloned into a local `scripts` folder during setup.
- **Distribution Model:** The application is distributed as a folder. A one-time `setup` script prepares the environment. A `run` script launches the app.

## 4. Recent Major Accomplishments
1. **Critical Rollback Bug Fix**: Resolved issue where failed scripts were incorrectly marked as "completed" instead of triggering rollback.
2. **Success Marker System**: Implemented reliable failure detection using `.workflow_status/{script_name}.success` files.
3. **Script Updates**: All 19 workflow scripts updated with success marker functionality.
4. **Configuration Fixes**: Corrected script name mismatches in workflow.yml files.
5. **Interactive Functionality**: Restored proper interactive script execution while maintaining enhanced failure detection.

## 5. Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
1. **Terminal Auto-scrolling**: Investigate and fix JavaScript-based auto-scrolling reliability.
2. **Enhanced Logging**: Improve GUI feedback and real-time information display.
3. **Script Update Mechanism**: Enhance reliability and user experience of script updates.
4. **Workflow Validation**: Implement validation for `workflow.yml` file syntax and structure.
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Perform full end-to-end testing on both macOS and Windows platforms.
