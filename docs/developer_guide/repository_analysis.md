# Repository Structure Analysis

This document analyzes the current dual-repository structure of the `sip_lims_workflow_manager` project and outlines the problems associated with it.

### Current Structure

1.  **Primary Repository (`sip_lims_workflow_manager`):**
    *   **Location:** `.`
    *   **Purpose:** Contains the main application logic, documentation, and project configuration.

2.  **Nested Repository (`scripts`):**
    *   **Location:** `./scripts`
    *   **Purpose:** Contains a collection of Python scripts used by the main application but versioned independently.

### Historical Context & Intended Workflow

Further investigation has revealed that the nested repository structure is a deliberate design choice to facilitate development. The intended workflow is as follows:

1.  **Production Environment:** In a production setting, the `scripts` are managed independently and are not part of the main application's repository. The application fetches or locates them through a separate mechanism.
2.  **Development Environment:** For development, the `setup.bat` script clones the `sip_scripts_workflow_gui` repository into the local `scripts` directory. This is triggered by the `APP_ENV=development` setting in the `.env` file. This allows developers to work on the application and the scripts simultaneously using their latest, unreleased versions.

### Identified Problems

While the intent is valid, the implementation via nested Git repositories introduces several significant problems:

1.  **Cognitive Overhead:** Developers must constantly be aware of which repository they are working in, increasing mental load and the risk of committing changes to the wrong place.
2.  **Branching Complexity:** The use of identically named branches in both repositories (e.g., `feature/data-harmonization`) is highly confusing and error-prone. It is impossible to distinguish between them without inspecting commit histories.
3.  **Implicit Dependency:** The main application depends on the state of the `scripts` repository, but this dependency is not explicitly tracked. This can lead to version mismatches and runtime errors when cloning the project.
4.  **Tooling Issues:** Many development tools do not handle nested repositories well. Git operations can become ambiguous, and the parent repository can have uncommitted changes simply because the nested repository's HEAD has changed.
5.  **Lack of Atomic Commits:** It is impossible to make a single, atomic commit that spans changes in both the application and the scripts. This requires two separate commits in two different repositories for a single logical change, making the project history difficult to follow and increasing the risk of breaking changes.
