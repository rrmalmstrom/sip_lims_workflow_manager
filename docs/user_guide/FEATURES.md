# Application Features

This document provides a detailed overview of the key features of the SIP LIMS Workflow Manager.

## Interactive Workflow Checklist

The main interface of the application is an interactive checklist that visually represents the steps of your laboratory workflow. Each step is displayed as a card with its current status.

-   **Status Indicators**: Each step is clearly marked with its status:
    -   ⚪ **Pending**: The step has not yet been run.
    -   ⏳ **Running**: The step is currently being executed.
    -   ✅ **Completed**: The step has been successfully completed.
    -   ⏩ **Skipped**: The step was marked as completed outside the workflow during project setup.
    -   ⏭️ **Skipped (conditional)**: The step was skipped as a result of a conditional decision.
    -   ❓ **Awaiting decision**: The workflow is paused pending a "Yes" or "No" decision from the user.
-   **Run/Re-run Buttons**: Each step has a "Run" or "Re-run" button, allowing you to execute or re-execute steps as needed. Re-run functionality is only available for steps that have been configured to allow it.

## Project Setup

The application provides a streamlined process for setting up new and existing projects.

-   **Automatic Detection**: The application automatically detects the state of a project folder and guides you through the setup process.
-   **New Project**: If you are starting a new project, the application will initialize the workflow with all steps marked as "pending."
-   **Existing Work**: If you are working with a project that has already been partially completed outside of the workflow manager, you can use the "Skip to Step" feature to mark all previous steps as "skipped" and start the workflow from any step.

## Conditional Workflows

The workflow manager supports conditional steps that allow for branching logic in your workflow.

-   **Decision Prompts**: When a conditional step is triggered, the application will display a prompt asking for a "Yes" or "No" decision.
-   **Workflow Branching**:
    -   If you select "Yes," the conditional step will be activated and run.
    -   If you select "No," the conditional step and any dependent steps will be skipped, and the workflow will jump to the specified target step.

## Granular Undo

The application features a robust, granular undo system that allows you to roll back the project state with precision.

-   **Undo Last Step**: The "Undo Last Step" button in the sidebar allows you to revert the project to the state it was in before the last completed step was run.
-   **Multi-Run Undo**: If a step has been run multiple times, the undo function will first revert to the state after the previous run. Subsequent undos will continue to roll back through the history of runs for that step.
-   **Conditional Undo**: The undo system is fully integrated with conditional workflows, allowing you to undo back to a decision point and make a different choice.

## Interactive Terminal

When a script is running, the application displays a live, interactive terminal that provides real-time feedback and allows you to interact with the script.

-   **Real-Time Output**: The terminal displays the script's output in real-time, so you can monitor its progress.
-   **User Input**: If a script requires user input, you can type your input directly into the terminal's input box and press "Enter" or click "Send Input."
-   **Script Termination**: A "🛑 Terminate" button is available for all running scripts, allowing you to safely stop a script at any time. When a script is terminated, the application will automatically roll back to the state it was in before the script started.

## Unified Update System

The application features a unified update system that manages both application and script updates.

-   **Automatic Update Checks**: The application automatically checks for updates every 60 minutes and on page refresh.
-   **Non-Intrusive Notifications**: When updates are available, a discreet notification will appear at the top of the main content area.
-   **Expandable Details**: You can click on the notification to expand a section with details about the available updates for both the application and the scripts.
-   **User-Controlled Updates**: All updates require explicit user approval. Application updates are downloaded manually from GitHub, while script updates can be applied with a single click from within the application.
